Welcome to Topika, a free & open-sourced Discord bot to help encourage community engagement. You can either choose
to host the bot yourself, with the steps listed below, or use our hosted version, free of charge.

Please note, the self-hosted version might not be as heavily updated as the main version, but you are free to make your own adjustments as you see fit, the code is very basic and easy to understand.
