# Topika

Welcome to Topika, a free & open-sourced Discord bot to help encourage community engagement. You can either choose
to host the bot yourself, with the steps listed below, or use our hosted version, free of charge.

If you like the bot, please leave a star on the repository to let other users know you enjoyed, and if you **really** liked it, feel free to [buy me a coffee (donate)](https://buymeacoff.ee/dawson), it helps a lot!

Please note, the self-hosted version might not be as heavily updated as the main version, but you are free to make your own adjustments as you see fit, the code is very basic and easy to understand.


## Self Hosting

In order to self host the bot, you will need to create an application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), making sure that all of the intents are enabled. 

You will also need to create an `.env` file in your project, with the following information, or alternatively, see the provided `.env.example` file.

`BOT_TOKEN` - This can be found in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

`CLIENT_ID`- This can also be found on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and is usually a string of **18** numbers.

`COLOR` - This can be either a word color, such as **PINK**, or a specific hexidecimal color.
